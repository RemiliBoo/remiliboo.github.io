                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I began my journey at Grodno University, where I studied programming and graduated in 2020. After university, I decided to entered professional courses at IT Academy, where i learned the programs like Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator.
                    After completing the courses, I joined a small company focused on startups. As the sole designer, I was responsible for entire project lifecycles â€” from concept to final delivery.
                    To improve my skills, I entered the Lanit Tercom School, where I led a team of designers and coordinated with developers, analysts and QA. This role improved my leadership and communication abilities.
                    Later, I moved to Minsk and worked as a UI/UX and Graphic Designer at a gambling company.I was developing websites, slot machine interfaces, creating marketing materials, develop brand identities for new products.
                    I also worked a lot with AI.</p>
